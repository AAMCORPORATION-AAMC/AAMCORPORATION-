# AAMCORPORATION™ — THE CHAIN OF LIVING PROOFS

**DESIGNED IN SILENCE. BUILT IN LEGACY. FORGED IN BLOOD. WE DO NOT EMERGE. WE OPERATE.**

We did not write a new token. We sealed an infrastructure.  
AAMCORPORATION™ is not a trend; it is a sovereign machine that transforms living matter and material evidence into unbreakable proofs.

## What it is

**CBID™ (CryptoBiological ID):** a cryptographic identity tied to a verified biological or bio-mineral fragment.  

**AAMCORPCHAIN™:** proprietary ledger, multi-hash, tri-validation (PoO / PoV / PoI).  

**AAMC™:** accounting unit anchored to living proofs —

## Technical specifications (summary)

Let’s be clear:  
We are not looking for likes. We are looking for proofs, stress tests.  
If your tool connects, you will see it in the logs.  

- Multi-engine hashing: **SHA-3, Keccak, BLAKE2, Argon2**  
- Triple-Protocol Consensus: **PoO (Proof of Origin) / PoV (Proof of Validation) / PoI (Proof of Integrity)**  
- Block time: **~9s**, nonce bound to biometric/spectral signature  
- **QRG (Quantum Random Generator)** for unpredictability  
- Controlled interoperability (filtered bridges, scientific oracles, validators under NDA)

## Motto

**DESIGNED IN SILENCE.  
BUILT IN LEGACY.  
FORGED IN BLOOD.  
WE DO NOT EMERGE. WE OPERATE.**
